# "Quality Control of M-CTSU Time To Activation (TTA)"

## Reading in Data

We will start by reading in data received from Kate Huffman from May 4, 2021. Then clean up variable names, then clean up messy excel dates, then remove calculated fields. The result is saved as the object, ttadata.

```{r data}
ttadata <- readxl::read_excel("Time to Activation 5.4.2021.xlsx", sheet = "Time to Activation 5.4.21") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # clean names, then dates
  mutate(irb_final_approval = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(irb_final_approval)), irb_application_submitted = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(irb_application_submitted)),
  billing_calendar_received = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(billing_calendar_received)),
   care_designations_completed = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(care_designations_completed)),
  internal_budget_finished = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(internal_budget_finished)),     
  pi_approved_budget = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(pi_approved_budget)),   budget_negotiations_start = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(budget_negotiations)),  final_budget = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(final_budget)),          paf_routed = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(paf_routed)), 
    contract_executed= excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(contract_executed)),      pan_released = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(pan_released)),           open_to_accrual = excel_numeric_to_date(as.numeric(open_to_accrual))
    ) %>% # now clean up prior math
  select(-feasibility_approval_to_irb_application_submitted) %>% 
  select(-feasibility_approval_to_internal_budget_finished) %>% 
  select(-budget_negotiations_to_final_budget) %>% 
  select(-feasibility_approval_to_paf_routed) %>% 
  select(-budget_negotiations) %>% # clean up dates
  mutate(feasibility_approval = as.Date(as.POSIXct(feasibility_approval,tz="Detroit"))) %>% mutate(intake_form_completed = as.Date(as.POSIXct(intake_form_completed,tz="Detroit"))) %>%#now relocate cols
  relocate(.after = "irb_application_submitted", "irb_final_approval" ) %>% 
  relocate(.after = "billing_calendar_received", "internal_budget_finished", "pi_approved_budget", "budget_negotiations_start", "final_budget")
```

## Exploring Missing Data (NAs)

```{r}
visdat::vis_dat(ttadata)
```

## Calculating Intervals in Days

Now we will add variables for calculated intervals in days. Start with intake to feasibility approval.

```{r}
ttadata <- ttadata %>% 
  mutate(time_intake_feasibility = as.numeric(feasibility_approval - intake_form_completed)) %>% 
  mutate(time_feasibility_irbsubm=as.numeric(irb_application_submitted - feasibility_approval)) %>% 
  mutate(time_irbsubm_irbfinal = as.numeric(irb_final_approval - irb_application_submitted)) %>% 
  mutate(time_bcrecvd_feasibility=as.numeric(feasibility_approval - billing_calendar_received)) %>% 
  mutate(time_bcrecvd_intbudgdone=as.numeric(internal_budget_finished - billing_calendar_received)) %>% 
  mutate(time_intbudgfinal_piapp=as.numeric(pi_approved_budget - internal_budget_finished)) %>% 
  mutate(time_piapp_budgetnegstart=as.numeric(budget_negotiations_start - pi_approved_budget)) %>% 
  mutate(time_budgetnegstart_finalbudget=as.numeric(final_budget - budget_negotiations_start)) %>% 
  mutate(time_piappbudg_budgetnegstart=as.numeric(final_budget - budget_negotiations_start)) %>% 
  mutate(time_irbfinal_pafrouted=as.numeric(irb_final_approval - paf_routed)) %>% 
  mutate(time_finalbudg_pafrouted=as.numeric(paf_routed - final_budget)) %>% 
  mutate(time_pafrouted_panreleased=as.numeric(pan_released - paf_routed)) %>% 
  mutate(time_panrel_open2accrual=as.numeric(open_to_accrual - pan_released)) %>% 
  mutate(time_contrexec_panrel=as.numeric(pan_released - contract_executed)) %>%  mutate(time_finalbudget_contrexec=as.numeric(contract_executed - final_budget)) %>%
  mutate(time_feasib_contrexec=as.numeric(contract_executed - feasibility_approval)) %>%
  mutate(time_irbfinal_contrexec=as.numeric(contract_executed - irb_final_approval))

ttadata %>% ggplot(aes(time_intake_feasibility)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

## Consider filtering by sponsor_type = "Industry"

## Consider faceting by CTSU

## Testing out the ggQC package

Start with a XmR plot of the interval from intake to feasibility approval.

```{r}
ttadata %>% 
  drop_na(intake_form_completed, time_intake_feasibility) %>% 
  arrange(intake_form_completed) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = intake_form_completed-17897, 
           y = time_intake_feasibility)) + #init ggplot
  geom_point() + geom_line() + #add the points and lines
  stat_QC(method = "XmR", #specify QC charting method
      auto.label = T, # Use Autolabels
      label.digits = 2, #Use two digit in the label
      show.1n2.sigma = T  #Show 1 and two sigma lines
          ) +  
  stat_QC(method="mR") +
  scale_x_continuous(expansion(mult = 1.15)) + # Pad the x-axis
  labs(x = "Days Since Jan 1, 2019",
       y = "Time from Intake Form to Feasibility Approval")
```

Now try a QC violations plot.

```{r}
QC_Violations <- 
  ggplot(ttadata, aes(x = intake_form_completed, y = time_intake_feasibility)) + #init ggplot
  stat_qc_violations(method = "XmR" 
       #show.facets = 4 #if you just want facet 4
                     )
QC_Violations
```

## Testing the Runcharter package

### Runcharter with time from intake to feasibility approval

          grpvar = sponsor_type,
          datecol = intake_form_completed,
          yval = time_intake_feasibility,
           line_colr = "gray80",
